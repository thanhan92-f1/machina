-- Native SSH keypair catalog — part of the OpenStack-client replacement ("Fleet
-- Cloud" native compute). A named public key an operator picks at instance-create
-- time via cloud-init (Machina has no private-key generation/storage — only the
-- public key is ever stored, matching how cloud-init ssh_authorized_keys works).
