# Mission Control

## Purpose

Mission Control — multi-host platform overview.

## When to use it

- Operate **Mission Control** when your job matches this page
- Use Mission Control (`/platform`) for fleet-wide work; use Core routes for this host only
- Confirm PAM/OIDC login and roles if actions are missing

## How to get there

- Route: `/platform`
- Nav: **Platform → Mission Control** (or spotlight / Finder search)

## Operate from the console (UX)

1. Open the route against the Machina daemon (`https://<host>:5092`) and wait for live data.
2. Filters / tabs: **?mission=1 geography; host/VM dock**.
3. Create VM (wizard).
4. Use Launchpad tiles.
5. Power VM.
6. Ask Zyra.
7. Geography expand.
8. Live Wall.
9. **Empty:** No hosts → Add host / enroll.
10. **Success:** Hosts online; VM create task; hero Operational.

If the page stays empty, check daemon health (`/api/v1/health`), libvirt connectivity, and whether the feature requires Fleet Cloud or Mission Control enrollment.
