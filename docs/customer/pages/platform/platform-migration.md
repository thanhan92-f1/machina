# Migration Radar

## Purpose

Migration Assistant — Machina Platform page at `/platform/migration`.

## When to use it

- Operate **Migration Radar** when your job matches this page
- Use Mission Control (`/platform`) for fleet-wide work; use Core routes for this host only
- Confirm PAM/OIDC login and roles if actions are missing

## How to get there

- Route: `/platform/migration`
- Nav: **Platform → Migration Assistant** (or spotlight / Finder search)

## Operate from the console (UX)

1. Open the route against the Machina daemon (`https://<host>:5092`) and wait for live data.
2. Filters / tabs: **vCenter / ESXi / OVF·OVA / VMDK / Cloud Image**.
3. Scan source.
4. Open import wizard.
5. Import.
6. **Empty:** No scan yet → pick source.
7. **Success:** Discovered VMs importable.

If the page stays empty, check daemon health (`/api/v1/health`), libvirt connectivity, and whether the feature requires Fleet Cloud or Mission Control enrollment.
