# Incident Commander

## Purpose

Incident Commander — Machina Platform / Security page at `/platform/zyra/incidents`.

## When to use it

- Operate **Incident Commander** when your job matches this page
- Use Mission Control (`/platform`) for fleet-wide work; use Core routes for this host only
- Confirm PAM/OIDC login and roles if actions are missing

## How to get there

- Route: `/platform/zyra/incidents`
- Nav: **Platform / Security → Incident Commander** (or spotlight / Finder search)

## Notes

- Formerly documented under `/platform/zeus*` (except Zeus Security Center, which remains `/platform/zeus/security`).

## Operate from the console (UX)

1. Open the route against the Machina daemon (`https://<host>:5092`) and wait for live data.
2. Open approvals.
3. Runbook.
4. **Empty:** —.
5. **Success:** Incident advanced/closed.

If the page stays empty, check daemon health (`/api/v1/health`), libvirt connectivity, and whether the feature requires Fleet Cloud or Mission Control enrollment.
