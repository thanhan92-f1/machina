 * The capture happens during render, on the false -> true transition of `active`, and NOT inside
 * an effect. React applies a child's `autoFocus` at commit, before any effect runs, so an
 * effect-time `document.activeElement` is already the dialog's own input or button, which is
 * about to unmount; restoring focus to it drops keyboard users onto <body>.
